# Forecasting Thailand Electricity Consumption by STL

This project aims to study Thailand monthly electricity consumption in the past 22 years during 2002 to 2023. Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series, while Loess is a method for estimating nonlinear relationships.
